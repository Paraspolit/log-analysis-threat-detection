# Log Analysis and Threat Detection
Threat detection project using Splunk, Wireshark, and Nmap for log analysis and incident response

This project demonstrates my skills in analyzing security logs, detecting threats, and responding to incidents using industry-standard tools commonly used in cybersecurity roles.

## Tools Used
- **Splunk:** For collecting and analyzing security logs to identify suspicious activities.
- **Nmap:** To perform network scanning and discover potential vulnerabilities.
- **Wireshark:** For monitoring and analyzing network traffic.
- **Microsoft Defender / Azure Sentinel:** For threat detection, alerting, and incident response within cloud and endpoint environments.

## Project Overview
In this project, I worked on identifying and analyzing potential security threats by examining logs and network data. This involved scanning networks, inspecting traffic, and using SIEM tools to detect anomalies and respond effectively.

## Skills Highlighted
- Log analysis and event correlation  
- Network scanning and vulnerability identification  
- Incident detection and response  
- Use of SIEM tools for monitoring and alerting  
- Understanding of endpoint and cloud security solutions

## Conclusion
This project reflects my commitment to maintaining secure digital environments by proactively identifying risks and supporting organizational security goals. I am eager to continue learning and growing in the cybersecurity field.
